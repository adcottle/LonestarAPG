This Forum User's Guide provides a quick introduction to LSC Forum features and initial preference configuration. Information on more advanced features and details on usage can be found in the online "HELP" that can be accessed from the TOP NAVBAR once you login to the forum.
<br />
<br />
Please <a href="http://lonestarapg.com/contact.htm">contact our webmaster</a>  if you have any problems understanding this guide or if there are additional topics that should be added.

<h2>
<a name="defines">DEFINITION OF FORUM TERMS</a>
</h2>
NOTE: One of the terms used on the Lone Star Chapter (LSC) forum differs from the term used on the APG forum. This is due to the different forum applications used. Definitions for BOTH forums are shown here to help keep the terms straight.<br /><br />
In addition to the slight difference in terms there is a major difference in the features offered by the two forums. Our forum allows those of us who prefer
<a href="#notifications">e-mail notifications</a> more control over when notifications will be sent to let you know about forum updates. <br /><br />

<br />
<br />

Web site URL, logo, and forum name
</li><li>
a HELLO message with your user name and the date/time you logged in
</li><li>
QUICK LINKS to 
<ul><li>"Show unread posts since last visit" (<b>THIS IS THE QUICKEST WAY TO SEE WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE YOUR LAST VISIT</b> if you don't use <a href="#notifications">e-mail notifications</a>. This doesn't work on your first login as you have no "official" last visit time.)

"Show new replies to your posts"

<br />After setting <a href="#notifications">e-mail notifications</a> preferences you also click one or more of the NOTIFY buttons. 
Then when a new TOPIC or reply is posted in this BOARD you will receive e-mail just like on a mail list. Do this for EACH of the boards and everything on the forum will come to your e-mail inbox. 
<br /><br />If you do not want to be notified of ALL POSTS to the BOARD do not use this button. Each individual TOPIC screen also has a NOTIFY button to allow you to be notified of replies to the individual TOPIC.

<a name="topics">THE TOPIC WINDOW</a>

Click on a TOPIC Title in the BOARD window to view the TOPIC POST and REPLIES. This image shows the placement of some items you can personal in your PROFILE such as your "Personal Message" and "Signature."  Use the REPLY button to post a reply to this TOPIC. Replying to a topic is similar to creating a new topic as explained in the next section.<br />

<h2>
<a name="createtopic">CREATE A NEW TOPIC OR REPLY TO A TOPIC</a>
</h2>

Click on the <b>NEW TOPIC</b> button in the <b>BOARD </b>window to start a new topic. A similar screen is displayed when you click REPLY to an existing topic.

<br /><br />
The forum should be used to discuss any topics of interest to Lone Star Chapter APG members. This is our place to freely discuss topics of interest to many of us. Personal messages between members should be handled via direct e-mail or using the "Private Message Feature" of the forum.

<br /><br />
<div class="imgctr">
<img src="30posttopic.jpg" width="762" height="423" border="0" alt="post topic">
</div>
To create a new topic:
<ul><li>
enter a subject (this will be prefilled if you REPLY to an existing topic)
</li><li>
and enter your text into the large text box.
</li><li>
After entering your message 
<ul>
<li>click "Spell Check" and correct any spelling errors, 
</li><li>
then click "Preview" to see what the message will look like when displayed,
</li><li> then click "Post" to send the message or reply. 
</li></ul>
</li><li>
All other items are OPTIONAL and can be ignored by most users but are briefly described here:
<ul><li>
most of the time the standard message icon (looks like 2 pieces of paper) will not need to be changed but there is an option to change it to<br />
		- thumbs up or thumbs down
<br />
		- exclamation point or question mark
<br />
		- lamp or smiley with several smiley options
</li><li>
the buttons can be used to make text bold, italics, etc. Placing your mouse cursor over a button will display a tooltip telling what the button will do to the text.  These work similar to the buttons in a word processor in that you enter text, highlight the text then click a button to apply that option to the highlighted text. Instead of displaying in bold, etc. what you will see are some codes inserted to cause the text to be displayed in your selected format. If you aren't familiar with HTML coding this may look strange but you can use the preview button under the message text box to be sure the message will display as you desired.

<br />
<br />
The buttons are: bold &nbsp;&nbsp; italics &nbsp;&nbsp;underline &nbsp;&nbsp;strikethrough &nbsp;&nbsp;glow &nbsp;&nbsp;shadow &nbsp;&nbsp;marque &nbsp;&nbsp;preformat-text&nbsp;&nbsp; left-align &nbsp;&nbsp;center&nbsp;&nbsp; right-align. 
</li><li>
Other buttons will be familiar to those who know HTML or design Web pages and can be ignored by those who don't. 
<br /><br />
The buttons are: hr&nbsp;&nbsp; font-size &nbsp;&nbsp;font-face&nbsp;&nbsp; change-color-box &nbsp;&nbsp;flash&nbsp;&nbsp; image&nbsp;&nbsp; hyperlink &nbsp;&nbsp;e-mail &nbsp;&nbsp;ftp-link &nbsp;&nbsp;table&nbsp;&nbsp; table-row &nbsp;&nbsp;table-column &nbsp;&nbsp;superscript&nbsp;&nbsp; subscript &nbsp;&nbsp;TTY code&nbsp;&nbsp; quote&nbsp;&nbsp; list.
</li><li>
A row of smileys allows you to click on one and the code for it will be inserted into your message at the point where the cursor is sitting

Calendar - view the calendar within the forum. This is separate from the calendar displayed to the public on our Web pages at http://lonestarapg.com/events.htm - the Web site calendar can only be modified by the Webmaster but any member can post events on the forum calendar. The forum calendar allows you to click on any event to see additional information about that event. To post an event on the forum calendar use the drop-down boxes at the bottom of the screen to navigate to the appropriate month and year, click the "Post event" link. The "Event Title" will be displayed on the calendar. You can specify a start date, a range of days, the board to which the event information should be posted, and a subject line for the posting. Posting an event is similar to posting a topic to a board. See XXX for additional information on posting.
<br />
Members - allows viewing a complete list of members, their e-mail address, Web site URLs and instant message contact information, as well as the date they were added to the forum and the number of posts they have made. Sadly for some of us, the forum does not support separate fields for given name and surname so name sorts are done by first name. You can navigate through the multi-page list of members by clicking on a page number on the left side of the member table header and footer or by clicking a letter of the alphabet for the first name of the member.

<h2>
<a name="password">FORGOTTEN PASSWORD</a>

If you have forgotten your password you can change it via an e-mail link or use a "Secret question" to prompt you for a term that will allow you to change your password in the browser.

<br /><br />
To change your password click on "Forgot your password?" in the login window. <br />

<div class="imgctr">
<img src="01login.jpg" width="542" height="330" border="0" alt="login">

A short time later you will receive a message at your member e-mail address similar to the one below. X's below will be replaced by information specific to your member login.
