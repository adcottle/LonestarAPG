Why does it look fine on one browser and not another???
-------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes there are real differences between browsers, one may look fine,
the other "off" just a little.  This happens sometimes, and you will need
to tweek the HTML a bit for different possible browsers.

Sometimes, though, NETSCAPE may simply present a blank page.  It really
isn't blank, it is just that there were so many HTML errors it gave up
trying to display anything.  If that happens, then take a look at the page
source in the browser.  Often, you can obviously see that the headers or
footers do not have their complete HTML being displayed.  A table or form
is not clodes out, etc.  Often it is a direct result of not including the
entire code in the .inc file.

This is one reason the <h3>--cut here--<\/h3> tokens have been
implemented.  instead of cutting up your HTML files after editing them
with an HTML editor, you may place that token just above and below what
you believe to be the start and end of the code you desire agora.cgi to
use.  There is an example of how to do this in the DOC/options_files.txt
document.  Currently, for header, footer, productPage.inc and options
files have this is implemented.  

If you observe your code behaving strangely dpending on the browser, you
may just need to adjust the locations of the <h3>--cut here--<\/h3>
tokens.  Make sure you close out all tables and forms, HTML needs
beginning and ending tags!  If there is a <TABLE> tag, there must also be
a </TABLE> tag to close it out. 

Good Luck!
