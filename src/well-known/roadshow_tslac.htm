<h1>Ancestor Roadshow - Free Research Advice <br />
<a href="roadshow_form.pdf">Ancestor Roadshow Registration Form</a> </h1>
<br />
The Lone Star Chapter of APG is conducting a remote Ancestor Roadshow 
in conjunction with the <a href="http://ctgs.org/UpcomingMeetings.html">West Waco Library Genealogy Lock-In</a> and the<a href=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/"> Texas State Library and Archives Commission</a> (TSLAC) <b>"Genealogy After Dark"</b> program on  
October 21, 2011 in Waco and Austin, Texas. This is the first remote roadshow conducted and is being done as a test program. 
<br /><br />

Members of the Lone Star Chapter Association for Professional Genealogists will be available for <b>free</b> 15-minute consultations on a specific genealogical question.  The appointment consists of conversation between you and an APG member to discuss a specific research question. The consultant will do his/her best to offer advice on how solve the problem. Time limits preclude prolonged searches for resolutions, but consultants can give you ideas on the best approach and records to use as you research. Appointments are set up on first-come, first-served basis. Because this consultation will be done from a remote location, appointments will be pre-scheduled. If time slots are still available, appointments can be made at TSLAC the night of the program. 
<br /><br />
To pre-register for a consultation, please print <a href="roadshow_form.pdf">this linked registration form</a>, complete it, scan it, and e-mail it to <a href="javascript:mtow();"><img src="images/webm.gif" width="214" height="22" border="0" alt="webmaster"></a>, along with any pertinent documentation. Please send only the documents necessary to understand the problem. If additional information is needed, you will be contacted via e-mail. If you do not know how to print and scan in the completed application to send it as an e-mail attachment, you can type the questions and answers into an e-mail message and register that way.
<br /><br />

An appointment time will be e-mailed to you once your application and documents are reviewed. At the event, you will be directed to the place where the consultation will take place over an Internet connection (barring technical difficulties). At the time assigned, an experienced genealogist will discuss your problem and offer suggestions that may help further your research. If your problem is in an area in which no specialist is available, we will make our best effort to offer advice.
<br />
<br />
Due to the time limitations it is necessary to focus on a very specific research question. For example:

<ul><li>
There were four men with the same name in the same place at the same time. How can I determine which was my ancestor?
</li><li>
I need help determining my great-grandmother's maiden name. The documents I already have are (provide a brief list of sources here with details provided on the document).
</li><li>
My ancestor served in the Civil War. I have his pension file. What other records might be available to add to his story in this time-frame?
</li><li>
I can trace this family in every census but one. What techniques might I use to find them?
</li></ul>
Questions are not limited to these topics. These are just examples to show how you might focus on a very specific question.
