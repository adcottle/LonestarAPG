2600 West 7th Street, Suite 162, Fort Worth, TX, 76107<br />
phone: 817-831-5620<br /><br />
The entrance to the archives is on the east side of the shopping center. Look for the red awning over the door.
<br /><br />
This is the facility with microfilm records and computer access. There is no access on Saturday to the textual (paper) records which are held at a different location.
<br /><br />
There is access to some digital records that are not available on the public internet, including the institutional version of Ancestry.com which covers records not covered by the library version. Microfilm records are available and the archivists have some fabulous finding aids they use in-house that are not published online. This is a great chance to get individual help from those who know the archive records best while also having access to a large group of knowledgeable researchers willing to offer advice. Check out the NARA-SW website at <a href="http://www.archives.gov/southwest/">http://www.archives.gov/southwest/</a> to learn more about the records available.
<br /><br />
The 7th Street facility is in the shopping mall that used to be the Montgomery Ward Plaza. There are lots of shops and several restaurants in the immediate area: Pei Wei, Starbucks, Chick-Fil-a, a deli, a grill and pub, and a couple of more formal restaurants. After our meeting many of us will have lunch as a group or multiple groups at different restaurants. Or you can work in the archives which is open until 4:00 p.m. The research room holds 10-15 people so we may have to take turns at lunch and research if everyone wants to research after the meeting. <br /><br />
