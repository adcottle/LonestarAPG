			<h1>Code of Ethics and Professional Practices</h1>
			As a member of the Association of Professional Genealogists I agree that professionalism in genealogy requires ethical conduct in all relationships with the present or potential genealogical community. I therefore agree to:

			<ol>
				<li>Present research results and opinions in a clear, well-organized manner;</li>
				<li>Refrain from withholding, suppressing, or knowingly misquoting or misinterpreting sources or data;</li>
				<li>Report appropriately qualified genealogical conclusions in writing based on the weight of the evidence with fully and accurately cited sources;</li>
				<li>Represent my abilities, services, and credentials honestly, avoiding the use of misleading or exaggerated statements;</li>
				<li>Engage in sufficient continuing education to maintain competence and comply with applicable requirements;</li>
				<li>Prepare and abide by written agreements regarding applicable project scope, fees, charges, payment structures, and deliverables without concealment or misrepresentation;</li>
				<li>Disclose potential conflicts of interest;</li>
				<li>Maintain confidentiality of client communications and research, except as permitted in writing by the client or required by court or professional disciplinary proceedings;</li>
				<li>Treat information concerning living people with appropriate discretion;</li>
				<li>Refrain from violating or encouraging others to violate laws or regulations concerning copyright, rights to privacy, business practices, or other pertinent subjects;</li>
				<li>Refrain from mutilating, rearranging, or removing from their proper custodians printed, original, microfilmed, or electronic records;</li>
				<li>Give proper credit to the work of others and refrain from plagiarism;</li>
				<li>Refrain from soliciting established clients of another researcher through denigration, violation of laws or regulations, or other improper means;</li>
				<li>Refrain from behaviors or statements that malign or are maliciously calculated to injure the profession; individual genealogists; genealogical associations, programs, or educational organizations; or the Association of Professional Genealogists.</li>
