			<h1>Ancestor Roadshow - / Ask An Expert - Free Research Advice<br />
			<a href="http://lonestarapg.com/roadshow_form_fillable.pdf">Ancestor Roadshow Registration Form</a></h1>

			<p><br />
			The Lone Star Chapter of APG is hosting an Ancestor Roadshow at the <a href="http://www.waco-texas.com/cms-library/page.aspx?id=16">West Waco Library &amp; Genealogy Center</a>, 5301 Bosque Blvd., Suite 275 in Waco, Texas on <b>October 20, 2017</b>&nbsp;from 3:30-9:00 p.m. as part of the 17th annual Genealogy Lock-in.<br />
			<br />
			The Roadshow is an opportunity for you to enjoy a free 15-minute consultation with a professional genealogist from the Lone Star&nbsp;Chapter. You can ask questions about a specific genealogical problem or get general information on how to approach a research problem. This is an excellent chance to get expert advice on that &quot;brick wall&quot; dilemma or &quot;elusive ancestor&quot; in your family history research.<br />
			<br />
			Time slots are limited. Consultation sessions are limited to one-per-person on a first-come, first-served basis.Walk-up registration will begin at 3 p.m. on October 20. The registration process includes submitting a completed questionnaire describing the problem and the research done so far. An initial screening interview will determine which consultant can best answer your question.<br />
			<br />
			To participate in the Ancestor Roadshow please click on the <a href="http://lonestarapg.com/roadshow_form_fillable.pdf">linked registration form</a>, complete, save and email it to <a href="mailto:WMCLGenealogyCenter@wacotx.gov?subject=Roadshow%20registration">WMCLGenealogyCenter@wacotx.gov</a> to get your reserved time or&nbsp;bring completed form to the event along with any pertinent documentation starting at 3 PM on the day of the Roadshow. Email registration opens October 16 for the October 20 event. To participate in the Roadshow you must be either at the West Waco Library or at a participating library that is co-hosting the Roadshow. Visit <a href="http://www.wacolibrary.org/">www.wacolibrary.org</a> for more details.<br />
			<br />
			Due to the time limitations it is necessary to focus on a very specific research question. For example:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>There were four men with the same name in the same place at the same time. How can I determine which was my ancestor?</li>
				<li>I need help determining my great-grandmother&#39;s maiden name. The documents I already have are [provide a brief list of sources here with details provided on the document].</li>
				<li>My ancestor served in the Civil War. I have his pension file. What other records might be available to add to his story in this time-frame?</li>
				<li>I can trace this family in every census but one. What techniques might I use to find them?</li>
			</ul>
			Questions are not limited to these topics. These are just examples to show how you might focus on a very specific question.</div>
